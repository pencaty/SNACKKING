# SNACKKING
 
 We used three kinds of code: Java, PHP, and XML files.
 
 Java files are in SNACKKING/app/src/main/java/com/example/snackking. These files are used to operate the android application. For the detailed explanation, please refer to README.md file in that folder.
 
 PHP files are in SNACKKING/PHP files. These files are used to connect the android application with database and server and manage the data in database. For the detailed explanation, please refer to README.md file in that folder.

 XML files are in SNACKKING/app/src/main/res/layout. These files are used to design user interface for the android application. For the detailed explanation, please refer to README.md file in that folder.
